This is a repository showing all the quantum programs I wrote over the course of my internship under the Centre for Quantum Sciences and Technologies, RV University.
I have used the Quantum Development Kit provided my Microsoft's Azure Quantum. These programs are from their course titled 'Get started with Azure Quantum'.
